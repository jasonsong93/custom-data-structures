# Custom Data Structures & Algorithms

A personal playground for implementing data structures and algorithms from scratch.

## Goals

- Reinforce core computer science concepts
- Build custom implementations of common data structures
- Practice solving algorithmic problems
- Stay language-agnostic, but begin with idiomatic C# structure
